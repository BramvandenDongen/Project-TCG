# purpose
The purpose of the weapons would be to provide heroes with more agency. By providing a way to attack despite not having attack maneuvers in hand. Weapons should hopefully remove a sense of powerlessness from the game.
# Types
Building off of that having multiple weapon types could be interesting. Having class specific weapons is intriguing but could be more difficult to balance. 
# Restrictions
Of course a free attack every turn would likely be too strong for the game. Certain tradeoffs like having to put a card at the bottom of your deck to attack gives extra strategy to the attack but does come with a higher cost. An issue that does arise is the fact it will really kick a player when they're down when they have no cards in hand taking away the one constant throughout the game leaving them truly powerless.

# Concepts
### Generic sword
2 energy 5 attack once per turn
> the reason I want go for a 2 cost attack is because that is the amount of energy you get every turn so by attacking with your weapon you negate the energy you would've gained on the turn for a weaker attack.

### Occultist sword
2 energy 5 attack once per turn discard a random card
> As an additional cost discarding a card, which is kind of a downside for the occultist, because it is random they cannot guarantee they discard a good card

### Stalwart sword
2 energy 5 attack once per turn if it hits put up 2 shield
> It is a weaker attack with a upside if it hits.
