## Current rules text
defend 7, when you defend with this card deal 1 damage to target opponent
## Balance changes
### First version:
defend 8, when you defend with this card deal 2 damage to target opponent
### Post playtest 1:
defend 7, when you defend with this card deal 1 damage to target opponent
> I decided to lower the damage by because if you played both of the cards and fully defended the attack you would deal 5 damage to target opponent which was too much for me and never felt fun for the opponent
