## Current rules text
defend 2, when you defend with this card put up 3 shield
## Balance changes
### First version:
defend 4, when you defend with this card put up 3 shield
### Post playtest 1:
defend 2, when you defend with this card put up 3 shield
> I decided to lower the defense value on this card to 2 to make the card more balanced, what this used to say was basically 7 defense for 2 which is too high in my opinion
